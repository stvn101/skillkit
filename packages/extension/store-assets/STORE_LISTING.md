## Title
SkillKit - Save as Skill

## Summary (132 chars max)
Save any webpage as an AI agent skill file. One click, works across 46 coding agents.

## Description
SkillKit lets you save any webpage as a reusable AI agent skill with one click. The extension extracts page content directly in your browser and generates a SKILL.md file that works instantly across 46 coding agents including Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, Gemini CLI, Windsurf, and more.

How it works:
- Click the extension icon to save the current page as a skill
- Right-click any page and select "Save page as Skill"
- Select text, right-click, and choose "Save selection as Skill"

When you save a page, the extension extracts and converts page content locally in your browser — no data is sent to any server. The resulting skill file with auto-generated tags and YAML frontmatter is downloaded directly to your computer.

After saving, run `skillkit install <path>` to make the skill available to all your AI coding agents at once.

Features:
- Extracts and converts page content locally — no data sent to external servers
- Auto-generates YAML frontmatter with metadata
- Smart tag detection from 50+ tech keywords (weighted URL, heading, and body analysis)
- Context menu integration for quick saves
- Works on any webpage
- No account or API key required
